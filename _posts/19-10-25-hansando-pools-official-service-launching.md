<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear 12SHIPS Community, 12Ships Michael
Ahn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 12Ships team has taken a difficult
journey in the rapidly changing crypto market and semiconductor manufacturing
environment. In the meantime, we are preparing to finalize the production of
Panakseon 1 and to start the official service of Hansando Pool from October 26
as part of the Beta Service operation of Hansando Pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Panokseon 1 with a total of 60PH/s hash
power will be operational, with 10PH/s being prepared as BCH Mining via
Hansando Pool and 50PH/s as BTC Mining via ViaBTC. If you have an agenda on the
operation of Mining, if you can send us your opinion on the agenda of Hansando Pool,
we will operate it democratically through token holder voting in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hash factory to be used until the first
half of next year has been prepared. Please understand that it is difficult to
disclose the location for various reasons at the moments. Kindly refer to the
operation report to be posted on Oct.28 on the dashboard of Hansando Pool for
October beta service operation results and incineration plans, which include
electricity and operating costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To celebrate Hansando Pool’s official
service launch, we have prepared an event in OlleNature(https://ollenature.com/en),
so please join us in the celebration.</p>

<p>Please show your support for 12Ships' future
voyage.</p>
