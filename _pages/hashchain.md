Based on the high-level block chain related hardware / software technology accumulated by 12Ships, we have developed the PoW-based block chain network ‘HashChain’.</p>
<p class="content" style="width: 644px">
The HashChain allows anyone to record, store, validate, and recall important data without the risk of data transmission errors, hacking or tampering.</p>
<p class="content" style="width:542px">
This network is open to anyone who can access and use it, participate as a node, validate and create blocks, and receive a point reward, that can be used within a block-chain network.</p>
